        <h1>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h1>
        <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of enhancing a website to improve its visibility when people
            search for products or services related to the business in search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. The
            better visibility a website has in search results, the more likely it is to attract attention and draw
            prospective and existing customers to the business.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Aspects of SEO</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keyword Research:</strong> Identifying the words and phrases that potential customers use to find
                products or services related to your business.</li>
            <li><strong>On-Page SEO:</strong> Optimizing individual web pages to rank higher and earn more relevant traffic
                in search engines. This includes using keywords in titles, meta descriptions, headers, and content.</li>
            <li><strong>Off-Page SEO:</strong> Building backlinks from other reputable websites to increase your site's
                authority and trustworthiness.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical SEO:</strong> Ensuring that a website meets the technical requirements of modern search
                engines with the goal of improved organic rankings. This includes site speed, mobile-friendliness, and
                secure connections (HTTPS).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Importance of SEO</h2>
        <p>SEO is crucial for businesses because it helps increase online visibility, drives more organic traffic to
            websites, and ultimately leads to higher conversion rates. A well-optimized website can provide a better user
            experience, build trust with visitors, and establish authority in the industry.</p>
